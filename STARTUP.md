# Geting Started
To edit the code do a `git clone https://github.com/javatures/Portfolio-Frontend.git` in gitbash inside the the file folder directory on you local machine where you want the code cloned to.
- Open VS Code and open the folder.
- Run the following command:
    -`npm install (in a package directory, no arguments):`

Install the dependencies in the local node_modules folder.

In global mode (ie, with -g or --global appended to the command), it installs the current package context (ie, the current working directory) as a global package.

By default, npm install will install all modules listed as dependencies in package.json.

With the --production flag (or when the NODE_ENV environment variable is set to production), npm will not install modules listed in devDependencies. To install all modules listed in both dependencies and devDependencies when NODE_ENV environment variable is set to production, you can use --production=false.
